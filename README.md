Hello! Welcome to the famous Tsukiji fish market of Tokyo, Japan! We came here to collect data on some of the fish they have here 
but we didn't wake up at 5am for the tuna auction and by the time we showed up they were only left with a few species of fish. 
We got to work and gathered measurements from a few different species of fish and want you to train a regression model to predict
the weight of a fish using some of the features we were able to measure. We have no idea which features will be good predictors. 

30% of the data before we hand it to you and we will use that csv for scoring.

I created a function that accepts a csv path and returns the predictions of your regression model using our csv. The csv we use will contain all the columns. Using the pipenv shell and scikit learn, I tested multiple models to predict weight of fish for data I do not have.
